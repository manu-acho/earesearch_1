## Overview

Voice Market Prices is a mobile application that enables smallholder farmers to access current market prices using natural voice commands in Kiswahili. The app works entirely offline, making it accessible in areas with limited connectivity.

## Key Features

### Voice Interface
- **Natural language queries**: "Nini bei ya kahawa leo?" (What's the price of coffee today?)
- **Offline ASR**: No internet required for voice recognition
- **Multi-language support**: Kiswahili, Kikuyu, Luganda
- **Code-switching aware**: Handles mixed language queries

### Price Information
- **Real-time prices** from 20+ markets across Kenya
- **Historical trends** (30-day, 90-day, 1-year views)
- **Price comparisons** across different markets
- **Quality grades** and premiums

### Smart Alerts
- **Personalized notifications** when prices hit target levels
- **Market insights** based on historical patterns
- **Best time to sell** recommendations

## Technical Architecture

### Offline ASR
- **Vosk** speech recognition engine
- Custom agricultural vocabulary (5000+ terms)
- Model size: 45MB (optimized for mobile)
- Latency: Sub-300ms average

### Data Sync
- Opportunistic syncing when internet available
- SMS fallback for critical price updates
- Peer-to-peer data sharing via Bluetooth

### Privacy
- All voice processing on-device
- No cloud transmission of audio data
- Encrypted local storage
- User control over data sharing

## Field Deployment

### Pilot Program (2024)
- **800+ farmers** across 5 regions in Kenya
- **95% daily active usage** among onboarded farmers
- **4.6/5 average rating** from user feedback
- **78% reduction** in time to access market info

### Impact Metrics
- Average query time: **12 seconds** (vs. 8+ minutes for SMS)
- Information access frequency: **2.3x increase**
- Farmer confidence in pricing: **+42% reported improvement**

## User Feedback

> "Before, I had to wait hours for price information. Now I can ask while standing in my field." — Coffee farmer, Kiambu County

> "The voice system understands my Kikuyu accent better than my children understand my English!" — Tea farmer, Nyeri County

## Challenges & Learnings

### Technical Challenges
- **Acoustic variability**: Wind noise and background sounds in field environments
- **Battery life**: Continuous listening drains battery quickly
- **Model updates**: Distributing ASR model improvements offline

### Socio-Technical Challenges
- **Trust building**: Some farmers initially skeptical of automated systems
- **Gender access**: Need for targeted outreach to women farmers
- **Cooperative integration**: Balancing individual and collective information access

## Roadmap

### Near-term (Q4 2024)
- [ ] Expand to 3 additional languages
- [ ] Add voice-based negotiation tips
- [ ] Integration with cooperative management systems

### Medium-term (2025)
- [ ] Blockchain-based price verification
- [ ] P2P market coordination features
- [ ] Integration with digital payment systems
