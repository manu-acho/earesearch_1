## Overview

The Kiswahili Agricultural Speech Corpus is a comprehensive dataset designed to support the development of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for agricultural applications in Sub Saharan Africa. It includes diverse speakers, acoustic environments, and agricultural terminology.

## Contents

### Audio Data
- **120 hours** of transcribed speech
- **300+ unique speakers** (balanced by gender and age)
- **Field recordings** with natural acoustic conditions
- **16kHz sampling rate**, mono channel

### Transcripts
- Word-level transcriptions with timestamps
- Agricultural terminology annotations
- Code-switching markers (Kiswahili/English)
- Speaker metadata (anonymized)

### Vocabulary Coverage

The corpus includes:
- Market price queries and responses
- Weather information
- Best practice discussions
- Crop disease identification
- Fertilizer and input terminology
- Cooperative management

## Collection Methodology

### Ethical Considerations
- Informed consent from all participants
- Compensation for time ($5 USD per hour)
- Community approval through local cooperatives
- Data anonymization and privacy protection

### Recording Protocol
- Recordings conducted in natural farm environments
- Multiple acoustic conditions (open field, shade, storage facilities)
- Scripted scenarios + spontaneous conversation
- Quality control by native speakers

## Use Cases

This dataset enables:
1. Training ASR models for agricultural domains
2. Evaluating speech systems in challenging acoustic conditions
3. Research on code-switching and multilingual ASR
4. Development of voice-first agricultural applications

## Limitations

- Geographic focus on Sub Saharan Africa (Kenya, Tanzania)
- Limited coverage of regional dialects
- Imbalanced representation of crop types (coffee, maize dominant)
- Potential bias toward cooperative members
