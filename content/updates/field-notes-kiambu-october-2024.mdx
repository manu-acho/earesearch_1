## Context

Last week, our team spent five days at Kiambu Coffee Farmers Cooperative in central Kenya, conducting user testing for our voice market prices system and facilitating discussions about digital infrastructure governance.

## Key Observations

### Technology Adoption Patterns

The most enthusiastic adopters weren't necessarily the youngest or most tech-savvy farmers. Instead, we found:

1. **Prior experience with cooperative systems** was the strongest predictor of adoption
2. **Women farmers** were often more engaged, despite having less prior smartphone exposure
3. **Trust in cooperative leadership** significantly influenced willingness to try new tools

This challenges common assumptions about "digital natives" and suggests adoption is more about **social trust** than technical comfort.

### Voice Interface Surprises

**What worked better than expected:**
- Farmers' comfort with code-switching (Kiswahili/Kikuyu/English) in voice queries
- Tolerance for imperfect ASR accuracy if the system acknowledged uncertainty
- Use of voice for queries farmers would be embarrassed to ask humans (basic agronomic questions)

**What didn't work:**
- Continuous listening (battery drain and privacy concerns)
- Generic voice personas (farmers wanted recognizable, trustworthy "voices")
- Technical jargon in error messages

### Governance Discussions

The most valuable conversations weren't about features but about **who controls the system**:

- Who decides which markets get included in price data?
- How should algorithm improvements be prioritized?
- What happens if the technology company exits or changes terms?
- How can farmers collectively own and maintain digital infrastructure?

These aren't technical questions — they're **political and economic** questions that technology alone can't answer.

## Implications for Design

### Technical Changes
- Implement push-to-talk instead of continuous listening
- Allow cooperatives to customize voice personas
- Add "explain this to me like I'm new" mode for agronomic advice

### Governance Model
- Explore cooperative ownership models for ASR systems
- Design for "graceful degradation" if corporate partners exit
- Build in mechanisms for collective decision-making about features

### Research Agenda
- Study long-term impacts of information asymmetry reduction
- Investigate gender dynamics in voice technology access
- Measure effects on cooperative cohesion vs. individualization

## Quote of the Week

## Next Steps

1. Prototype cooperative governance UI for system configuration
2. Conduct gender-focused workshops on voice technology access
3. Begin longitudinal study tracking market outcomes over 12 months
4. Document governance model for replication in other cooperatives
