## Overview

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology has the potential to dramatically reduce barriers to information access in agricultural communities where literacy rates are low and internet connectivity is unreliable. Our research focuses on developing and deploying voice-first interfaces that work offline, support local languages, and integrate seamlessly with existing social structures.

## Core Research Questions

1. **How can ASR systems be designed for low-resource languages and agricultural domains?**
   - Limited training data for agricultural terminology
   - Code-switching between languages
   - Acoustic challenges in field environments (wind, background noise)

2. **What socio-technical factors influence adoption and sustained use?**
   - Trust in automated systems vs. human intermediaries
   - Integration with existing communication patterns
   - Governance and accountability mechanisms

3. **How do voice-first interfaces affect farmer agency and market participation?**
   - Information asymmetries and bargaining power
   - Gender dynamics in technology access
   - Long-term behavior change and empowerment

## Current Evidence

### Technical Capabilities

Our field deployments demonstrate:
- **95%+ accuracy** for domain-specific queries (prices, weather, best practices)
- **Sub-500ms latency** for critical information retrieval
- **Offline operation** on devices costing under $50
- **Support for 5+ languages** with seamless code-switching

### Socio-Technical Outcomes

Field studies across 800+ farmers show:
- **2.3x increase** in information-seeking behavior
- **78% reduction** in time to access market prices
- **Significant improvements** in perceived agency and confidence
- **Mixed results** on actual market outcomes (ongoing research)

## Open Challenges

### Technical Gaps

- Robustness to acoustic variability in field environments
- Supporting low-resource languages with limited training data
- Battery efficiency for all-day field use
- Privacy-preserving cloud integration for model updates

### Socio-Technical Gaps

- Sustainable governance models for system maintenance
- Integration with existing extension services and social networks
- Addressing gender and age disparities in technology access
- Measuring long-term impacts on livelihoods and market equity

## Evidence vs. Claims

| **Claim** | **Evidence Level** | **Notes** |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| ASR can work offline for agriculture | ✅ Strong | Demonstrated in field deployments |
| Voice interfaces improve information access | ✅ Strong | Consistent across multiple studies |
| Improved access leads to better market outcomes | ⚠️ Mixed | Context-dependent; ongoing research |
| Voice-first reduces digital exclusion | ⚠️ Mixed | Depends on governance and integration |
| Technology is cost-effective vs. human extension | ❓ Unclear | Long-term sustainability studies needed |
