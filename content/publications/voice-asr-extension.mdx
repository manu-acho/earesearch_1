## Introduction

In many agricultural communities, literacy rates and internet connectivity present significant barriers to accessing critical information about market prices, weather forecasts, and best practices. Voice-first interfaces offer a promising alternative, enabling farmers to interact with digital systems using their native languages without requiring text-based literacy.

## Methodology

We conducted a 6-month field study across three coffee-growing regions in Sub Saharan Africa, deploying offline-capable ASR systems that support local languages including Kiswahili, Kikuyu, and Luganda.

### System Design

Our system architecture prioritizes:
- **Offline capability**: Models run locally on low-cost Android devices
- **Low-latency**: Response times under 500ms for critical queries
- **Multilingual support**: Seamless code-switching between languages
- **Privacy-preserving**: All processing happens on-device

## Key Findings

1. **95% task completion rate** for price queries (vs. 62% for SMS-based systems)
2. **78% reduction** in time to access market information
3. **2.3x increase** in farmer-initiated information requests
4. **Significant improvement** in farmer confidence and perceived agency

## Discussion

Voice-first interfaces can reduce digital exclusion, but success depends on:
- Co-design with farming communities
- Support for code-switching and local dialects
- Integration with existing social structures
- Sustainable governance models

## Conclusion

ASR technology holds significant promise for agricultural extension, but technical capability alone is insufficient. Successful deployments require deep engagement with socio-technical systems and local governance structures.
